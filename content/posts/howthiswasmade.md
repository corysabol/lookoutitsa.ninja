## Motivation

Well, you see I've owned lookoutitsa.ninja domain for a good while now.
I never really got around to doing anything with it though. Then pretty recently I learned of
[Sapper](). In an effort to learn Sapper and Svelte I decided that I would finally put something up on
the net at lookoutitsa.ninja. As I began hacking away with Sapper + Svelte I realized that what I really 
wanted was a static site that allowed me to post blogs written using markdown which was deployed to 
Github pages for easy hosting. 

So, I built that exact thing and had a blast doing it! So, buckle up my ninja friends. This blog post
is going to show you exactly how I built this very site that you're reading this post on right now :)

## Enter Sapper + Svelte + CircleCI + Github Pages

For this website I wanted it to meet a few criteria:

- Be fast
  - This meant that it was likely going to need to be a static site
- Be simple and clean in design
- Be easy to maintain
- Support authoring blog posts in markdown (but isn't is a static site tho? We'll get to that)

So, having also just learned of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), which is designed to build fast slim web UI's (the word literally means slim or slender), I decided that it might be good fit and that I would like an excuse to give it a shot. Well that's where 
[Sapper]() comes into play.
