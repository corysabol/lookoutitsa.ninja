## Motivation

Well, you see I've owned lookoutitsa.ninja domain for a good while now.
I never really got around to doing anything with it though. Then pretty recently I learned of
[Sapper](). In an effort to learn Sapper and Svelte I decided that I would finally put something up on
the net at lookoutitsa.ninja. As I began hacking away with Sapper + Svelte I realized that what I really 
wanted was a static site that allowed me to post blogs written using markdown which was deployed to 
Github pages for easy hosting. 

So, I built that exact thing and had a blast doing it! So, buckle up my ninja friends. This blog post
is going to show you exactly how I built this very site that you're reading this post on right now :)
